    	<p><em>The God of the Woods</em> has given me a real book hangover, so I haven't picked up a new book just yet. I am, however, listening to Catherine Price's <em>How to Break up With Your Phone</em> (this html-learning endeavor is a direct result of this choice) which is perhaps the most written-in-2018-by-a-millenial book ever written. It's not bad! It provides some solid reasoning as to why you should consider "breaking up with your phone" and a pretty useful 30 day road map about how you might accomplish that feat. I'm looking forward to continuing to follow it.

    <p>&emsp;I've just finished Liz Moore's <em>The God of the Woods</em>. It's a thriller about a kid who goes missing from summer camp several years after her brother goes missing. It was a really engaging read after the first act. Throughout the first quarter of the book the constant shifts in perspectives and timelines made it something of a chore to follow. Ultimately, once I was able to get a good footing with each of the characters and timelines, the story really took off. I had read the first ~120 pages or so over the course of a week and a half, but given an unexpected severe weather day (thanks Marty, also congrats on your retirement) I was able to rip through the remaining 350 pages with relatively little trouble.<br><br>
    &emsp; Having read really no synopses of the book, I was expecting the titular "God of the Woods" to make a more tangible appearance in the novel, but it turns out that the title a more oblique reference to several of the characters' relationships to the land which they occupy. So, if not a supernatural thriller, what exactly is this book about? Well its' main plotlines revolve around two disappearences. The first of Bear Van Laar, the eldest son of the Van Laars, in 1961. The second revolves around the disappearence of his sister  14 years later in 1975. It ended up much more a "whodunnit" than I was expecting, but I found it very enjoyable nonetheless. Afterall, I love a good red herring. <br><br>
    &emsp; I picked this book up because I was tired of my <strong>BOTM</strong> books going unread for so long. I rarely read contemporary novels because I have such a bad habit of feeling as though I have to read all of the "important" books of the 20th century before I've "earned" reading something fun. I think this is the latent English Major in me. Who knows. I'll definitely be on the lookout to stumble across another Liz Moore book in the future. The writing was really well done. It's no small task to make a ~500 page book coherent, let alone one with about a dozen different narrators and at least 3 distinct timelines. On top of that the writing was really well creafted. She has a gift for imagery and the way that she renders that bizarre yearning of summer camp is really great. Lmk if you want to borrow the books.
