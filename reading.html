        <h2><em>The Secret History</em> by Donna Tartt</h2>
        <p><img src="tSH Cover.jpg" alt="The Secret History Cover" align="left" width="200">
          <br>&emsp;<em>The Secret History</em> is my current read. At time of writing, I have read through approximately
          half of the novel so far, and I'm starting to get the hype. Before I started reading, I had heard again and
          again that the book was pretentious, and boy is that right. However, I was thinking <em>House of Leaves</em>
          or <em>Infinite Jest</em> style pretension, but it is different in what feels like an important distinction.
          <em>The Secret History</em> is about pretentious <em>people</em> who view the world through their very
          specific classics-inflected lens. It draws heavily upon allusions to the classics, but at no point is the
          reader required to stop and check self-indulgent foot- or endnotes. So while there is a pretentious air to the
          novel, it feels like a self conscious critique of the type of real world pretenses that distort our characters
          minds and actions.<br><br>
          &emsp;The book is set at a tiny, elite private college in Vermont, and in the prologue, the reader finds out
          from the first line that one of the main characters is to be murdered by the rest of the characters. The rest
          of the first half of the book describes the lead-up to the aforementioned murder. I will say that this book is
          making me awfully nostalgic for college (except for the murder and other unpleasantries parts). The prose is
          really clear and Tartt's use of imagery is really impactful, especially as the book speeds towards the murder.
          I will update this review once the second half of the book is read.
