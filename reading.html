       	 <h2><em>Infinite Jest</em> by David Foster Wallace</h2>
        <p><img src="IJ Cover.jpg" alt="Infinite Jest Cover" align="left" width="200">
          &emsp;<em>Infinite Jest</em> (1996) is my current read. At time of writing, I have read through approximately a tenth of the novel. It is as pretentious and convoluted as its reputation would suggest. When I mentioned "Long Book 2026" to people, <em>IJ</em> was the book that was suggested or asked about most frequently. It's kind of the quintessential literature-bro book. A lot of the time reading the book is spent flipping to te end notes for clarification, definitions, explanations and at one point the fictional filmography of one of the characters. It is pretty satisfying to work through, though. When things click, they feel really satisfying.<br><br>

          &emsp;Normally I'd add a short synopsis of what's going on in the book, but at 10% in, I both have no idea and there are five or six threads already piling up on one another. Hopefully they will coalesce as I read on further. Some topics include modern American Consumerism, education, drugs and addiction, politics, tennis, and about a hundred other things. DFW's writing is extremely prescient. The book was written in 1996, and is set in the early-mid aughts, but the relationship to technology and consumerism that DFW identifies feels like he's writing right now. I'd read some of his essays from <em>Consider the Lobster</em>, and his style of writing is so compelling. This novel is full of the sort of long form observation that makes his nonfiction so interesting.
