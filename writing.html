    <h1>What I use to write</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I bought an old typing teaching tool called the AlphaSmart Neo 2 from ebay in order to get more distraction-free writing done.

      <br> It allows you to write plain text files directly to memory, and can store up to 8 different files. When you're ready to upload your work to your computer to edit it, it uses a USB-A to USB-B connection to emulate a keyboard and types it directly onto whatever file you have open. I typically transfer it directly into a Google Doc so that I know that the information is then saved automatically.
