  <h1>Welcome to Stephen's Attempt to learn HTML (and maybe CSS)</h1>
    <p1>I'm trying to use my phone <em>less</em> than before, so I'm picking this up as a way to document my new endeavors.<br>
      <br> So far, I'm trying to journal more, read more, and learn to crochet. I'm also trying to get back in better shape.</p1>
