		<h1>Stephen has declared that 2026 is the year of the long book.</h1>

		<p><br>The Blog is back, folks. Get excited. It's been quite a while since this blog has been updated, and I've since forgotten a lot of the skills required to keep up this blog, so it will be a steep re-learning curve.<br><br> 
			As you may have heard, 2026 is what I am dubbing "Long Book 2026." For the past few years I have set a goal of 50 books per year and woefully underperformed towards that goal, but its looming presence pushed me towards shorter books that I could digest quickly. I have nothing against shorter fiction, I think the American Modernists really perfected the ~250 page novel, and several of them are among my favorites. However, this tendency towards books that could be read quickly has caused me to eschew reading the real doorstops of novels that I've been meaning to read, but putting off for the last few years, so this year I'm focusing on 800+ page tomes in order to reset my reading attention span. A tentative list of the books I'm trying to get through this year is below. But I'm not holding myself to it too closely; that would feel a little antithetical to the purpose of the exercise.
