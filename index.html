    	<h1>Stephen is bringing back blogging, whether you like it or not.</h1>
    	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="Profile Photo.jpg" alt="This is a photo of me" width="200"></p>
    	<p><br>&emsp;I'm trying to use my phone <em>less</em> than before, so I'm picking this up as a way to document my new endeavors.<br>
      	<br> So far, I'm trying to journal more, read more, and learn to crochet.
      	<br>As you can also probably tell, I'm attempting to teach myself HTML and ESS. Hopefully this blog will look better in the near future.
