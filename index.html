      <br> So far, I'm trying to journal more, read more, and learn to crochet. I'm also trying to get <strong>back</strong> in better shape.</p1>
  
  <h2>Some things I want to accomplish</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reading more</li>
    <li>Learning to crochet, and creating a sweater</li>
    <li>Getting better at cooking, and doing it for my friends more often</li>
    <li>Finally getting around to finishing a short story.</li>
  </ul>
