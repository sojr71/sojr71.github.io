              &emsp; I've finished <em>How to Breakup With Your Phone</em>, and it hasn't worked yet. I've read through the book, but I have not completed the month-long process described in the book, but as things in my work life get increasingly crazy, I find myself less and less able to resist the temptation to turn my phone off by mindless scrolling. As for the book itself, I think that its basis is smart, and the steps are actionable. I do want to get my hands on the workbook version of the book, but I'm not willing to drop the money on it. Perhaps I'll look for a PDF of it. I'm hoping that it'll get easier to resist the temptation soon.

            <h2><em>The God of the Woods</em> by Liz Moore</h2>
            <p><img src="God of the Woods Cover.jpg" align="left" alt="God of the Woods Cover" width="200">
                &emsp;I've just finished Liz Moore's <em>The God of the Woods</em>. It's a thriller about a kid who goes
                missing from summer camp several years after her brother goes missing. It was a really engaging read
                after the first act. Throughout the first quarter of the book the constant shifts in perspectives and
                timelines made it something of a chore to follow. Ultimately, once I was able to get a good footing with
                each of the characters and timelines, the story really took off. I had read the first ~120 pages or so
                over the course of a week and a half, but given an unexpected severe weather day (thanks Marty, also
                congrats on your retirement) I was able to rip through the remaining 350 pages with relatively little
                trouble.<br><br>
                &emsp; Having read really no synopses of the book, I was expecting the titular "God of the Woods" to
                make a more tangible appearance in the novel, but it turns out that the title a more oblique reference
                to several of the characters' relationships to the land which they occupy. So, if not a supernatural
                thriller, what exactly is this book about? Well its' main plotlines revolve around two disappearences.
                The first of Bear Van Laar, the eldest son of the Van Laars, in 1961. The second revolves around the
                disappearence of his sister 14 years later in 1975. It ended up much more a "whodunnit" than I was
                expecting, but I found it very enjoyable nonetheless. Afterall, I love a good red herring. <br><br>
                &emsp; I picked this book up because I was tired of my <strong>BOTM</strong> books going unread for so
                long. I rarely read contemporary novels because I have such a bad habit of feeling as though I have to
                read all of the "important" books of the 20th century before I've "earned" reading something fun. I
                think this is the latent English Major in me. Who knows. I'll definitely be on the lookout to stumble
                across another Liz Moore book in the future. The writing was really well done. It's no small task to
                make a ~500 page book coherent, let alone one with about a dozen different narrators and at least 3
                distinct timelines. On top of that the writing was really well crafted. She has a gift for imagery and
                the way that she renders that bizarre yearning of summer camp is really great. Lmk if you want to borrow
                the books.
